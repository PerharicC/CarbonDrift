# CarbonDrift
Lagrangian 3d tracking of Gelatinous Zooplankton particles in the global ocean.

## Short description
CarbonDrift is an extension of the OceanDrift module in the opendrift python environment [(Dagestad et al., 2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324506124_OpenDrift_v10_a_generic_framework_for_trajectory_modelling). It models Gelatinous Zooplankton (GZ) vertical sinking using Decay Rate to Temperature dependenices from [Lebrato et al., (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GB006265), while also allowing for horizontal advection modeling.

This model was started as a summer-research project at the Slovenian Environment Agency (ARSO) in 2023 and was later enhanced and made into an open-source package during my masters-thesis research in physcis at ARSO (2024-2025), under the supervision of Asist. Prof. Dr. Matjaž Ličer and Asist. Prof. Dr. Tinkara Tinta.

We hope it may help future GZ modeling researchers, who are perhaps not as familiar in computer programing and will benefit greatly from the easy to use CarbonDrift module.

## Documentation
The documentation is available online at [the website](https://perharicc.github.io/CarbonDrift/index.html) and in the local folder docs, which can be accessed with a local live server.
